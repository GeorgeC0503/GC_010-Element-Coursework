# GC_010-Element-Coursework
This repository contains python codes for 010 Element for (MOD006203 TRI3 D01NON)

For this piece of coursework, I will be utilising a workplace derived dataset comparison of sensor and parameter values produced by our automated STR (Stir Tank Reactor) while performing a bacterial growth process. Interweaved with this “online” live data I will be introducing some offline data about cell population/cell number. The method which is used to determine cell density is OD600 (Optical Density / absorbance at 600 nm wavelength).
I will be using the following tasks to attempt to construct a robust model for cell density using the output values of the automated system. These values consist of measured feed (dm_feed) and atmospheric air administered. The dataset I have utilised also logs measured dissolved oxygen (DO) in the media broth however in this dataset DO is a logged response and may not pose as the best indicator of growth.
